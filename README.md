## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project analyzes solar activity data to analyse solar storms and their potential impact using data from the **Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI)**. RHESSI, a NASA space observatory, was launched in 2002 to study high-energy solar flares and particle acceleration mechanisms.

## 🚀 Context  
Solar flares release massive bursts of energy, heating plasma to millions of Kelvin and emitting X-rays. While these X-rays cannot penetrate Earth's atmosphere, space-based observatories like RHESSI provide crucial data for studying their dynamics. Understanding these flares is essential to predicting space weather and mitigating its effects on satellites, communication networks, and power grids.

## 📊 Data & Features  
The dataset includes key parameters such as:  
- **Peak rate**: Number of peaks per second in the 6-12 keV energy range.  
- **Total counts**: Integrated counts over flare duration.  
- **Energy levels**: Maximum energy detected (in keV).  
- **Radial distance**: Distance from the Sun's center.  
- **Quality codes**: Data reliability indicators.  

## 🛠 Methodology  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Data Cleaning**  
- **Visualization & Interpretation of Results**  

## ⚡ Why It Matters?  
Accurate solar storm predictions help protect **satellites, astronauts, and critical infrastructure** from the adverse effects of solar radiation.
